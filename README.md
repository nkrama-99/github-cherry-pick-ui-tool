## About

This tool simplifies the process of merging changes from one branch into another. You will need a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) from GitHub to use this tool (classic token with just full repo access should suffice).
